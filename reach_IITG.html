        <h1>How to Reach IIT Guwahati</h1>

        <br/><hr/>

        <h2><b>From Airport</b></h2>

        <h3><b>Via Car or Taxi</b></h3>

        There are various options for Cab. Make sure, you come to an agreeable amount before taking a Cab, which are around the airport area. This is a good option as you can lock the chargeable amount. Amount Rs 700-800 is agreeable. Ask whether they are charging extra Airport Parking fee and whether it is included in the price. <br><br>
        
        If you plan to use Uber, there are chances that Uber will show a decent price (say Rs 550). But somehow the driver will change the route and will make you roam around the city unnecessarily and Uber will settle the price at a higher rate (say Rs 900). You may end up paying more. So avoid Uber or cabs who are metering the journey. <br><br> 

        There are some cabs, who are highly trusted by the IITG commnunity. These are a couple. 

        <ul>
          <li>Bhabesh Ji - +91 99547 33253</li>
          <li>Amar Taxi - +91 60015 29956</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><b>Via Public Transport</b></h3>

        You can reach Jhalukbari through a shared Autorickshow or shared Cab or Assam Transport Bus. From Jhalukbari <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7SMNWD691cfMZZ5L6">Bus Stop</a>, you can take a autorickshaw to Amingaon and from Amingaon, take another autorickshaw to IITG KV Gate. This is the cheapest possible route. Many students use this. <br><br>

        <h3><b>Via IIT Bus</b></h3>

        <b>Option 1 :</b> You can reach Jhalukbari through a shared Autorickshaw or shared Cab or Assam Transport AC Bus. From Jhalukbari <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7SMNWD691cfMZZ5L6">Bus Stop</a>, take IITG bus to reach IITG campus. IITG bus has "Green Valley" written on it. The schedule for bus service can be found here "<a href="assets/Shuttle Bus Schedule.pdf">Shuttle Bus Schedule</a>". <br><br> 

        <b>Option 2 :</b> You can reach Guwahati Train Station <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1F4Po6z7LwrgwPYQ8">ASTC Bus Stand</a> through Assam Transport AC Bus and take IITG bus from Pan Bazaar <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JiYUbZBnXdNCHw9LA">IITG Bus Starting Point</a> near Reserve Bank Building. Assam Transport AC Bus makes trip from Guwahati Airport to Guwahati Train Station at (ir)regular intervals. IITG bus has "Green Valley" written on it. The schedule for bus service can be found here "<a href="assets/Shuttle Bus Schedule.pdf">Shuttle Bus Schedule</a>". This route will be very time consuming but cheap and comfortable.  <br><br> 

        <h3><b>OneStop IITG App</b></h3>
        Coordinate with any other person who is traveling on the same day and at the same time. This is real ride-sharing.

        <br><br>
