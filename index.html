          Hi, I am Chiranjib Sur. I completed PhD at CISE at University of Florida, where I worked as a Research Assistant with Prof. Dapeng Oliver Wu and at Multimedia Communications and Networking Laboratory (MCN), ECE, University of Florida. I was affiliated with NSF Center for Big Learning, Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research (FICS Research), UF Informatics Institute (UFII), UFII Student Data Analysis Seminar (SDAS), University of Florida Data Science and Informatics, University of Florida Transportation Institute (UFTI), all at University of Florida.

          In the past, I worked as a Research Associate at Soft Computing and Expert System Laboratory at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior, with Prof. Anupam Shukla. My current role was investigation, analysis, design and simulation work on research topics that are part of Government of India sponsored projects.

          I completed my graduate work (M.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering) at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior, a research based postgraduate institute for IT and Management, and worked with Prof. Anupam Shukla. Prior to that I worked at Infosys Technologies Limited for some time. I completed my undergraduate studies in Electronics & Communication Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India.

          Currently my research focuses on : Deep Learning, GAN, Image Captioning, Story Telling, Questioning Answering, Translation, Visual Questioning Answering and other applications related to Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, Security.

          My research interests include : Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery, Soft Computing & Computational Intelligence, Bio-Inspired and Swarm Intelligence, Robotics, Bio-Inspired Computation, Brain Computer Interface, Bio-Medical Applications and Knowledge Discovery from Faces, Data Structure & Algorithms. There are various other applications which I use for case studies related to Image Processing, Biometrics, Speech Processing, Biomedical Applications, Combinatorial Optimization and Graph based problems. I possess a lot of enthusiasm or research work in diversified fields related to Computer Science, Electronics, Optimization, Social Science and Cognitive Science.

          If someone needs some help or is eager to work collaboratively on common topics of interest, please feel free to contact me.
